I am a second-year master student of CS at ETH Zurich, and I think Informatik sounds better than Computer Science. My passion lies in visual computing, specifically image synthesis and restoration, on either rendered or real-life images. I hope to be able to restore plausibly any sort of damage to an image, or to a sequence of images.

A lot of my spare time is spent with my girlfriend (manually showing a heart :P ). Besides, I play 2 games: [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) and [minesweeper](http://www.minesweeper.info/worldranking.html). Both of them, to be honest, can easily be hacked. I have witnessed some cheat plays on both, but in my opinion, cheating is the least fun.
