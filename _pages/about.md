I am a second-year master student of CS at ETH Zurich, and I think Informatik sounds better than Computer Science. My passion lies in visual computing, specifically image synthesis and restoration, on either rendered or real-life images. I hope to be able to restore plausibly any sort of damage to an image, or to a sequence of images.

A lot of my spare time is spent with my girlfriend (manually showing a heart :P ). Besides, I play 2 games: [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) and [minesweeper](http://www.minesweeper.info/worldranking.html). Both of them, to be honest, can easily be hacked (although the easy hacks can also be easily detected). I have witnessed some cheat plays on both, but in my opinion, cheating is the least fun so I never did so myself. 

A year ago, I built the first version of this website with a different template. I only finished writing several short posts and it had not been updated since last September. The template was not functioning very well and has some potential bugs (maybe incompatibilities), so I decided to rebuild it. Another reason is that I think the former posts are not what I really wanted to write. I feel comfortable writing about technology in English, but not yet about daily life. Perhaps I will write bilingually, but I am not sure yet :)

This website is built out of the Jekyll theme [`jekyllDecent`](https://github.com/jwillmer/jekyllDecent).
