Sometimes I have to do some Excel operations. They say it is not good to show that you know Excel on your resume, but I do think sometimes it is handy :)

### Functions
#### 线性插值`TREND`
`trend([known_y], [known_x], new_x)` performs (least square) line fitting on `known_y` and `known_x` as $$y=ax+b$$ and predicts the $$y$$ value of `new_x`.

### Shortcuts and quick settings
* Recalculte all formulae: `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F9`.
* Automatic column width (or row height) for multiple columns (rows): `Home->Cells->Format->Click`!
