This post is mainly a reminder of some errors I have encountered with Git. Writting things down may help me avoid recurrent errors :)

#### GIT push: permission denied (public key)
* Happened when I wanted to `git push`. 
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19660744/git-push-permission-denied-public-key)
* Need to set up the SSH key and add it to Github (or wherever your `remote` is). 
* I was surprised when finding out that I didn't do it on my laptop! 

#### src refspec master does not match any.
* Happened when I wanted to `git push`. When creating my `github.io` repo, I didn't follow the process of forking the template and then modifying. I cloned the original repo, modified it and then wanted to push to the `origin` to the empty `github.io` repo that I created. At first it didn't work because the `origin` still points to the original repo which of course I cannot write to. Then I changed the `origin` by `git remote set-url` and it gave me this error. I thought it was because of not forking the repo, so I followed the recommended path again. But this error still persisted.
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4181861/src-refspec-master-does-not-match-any-when-pushing-commits-in-git)
* Turned out that the forked repo did not have the `master` branch, only a `gh-pages` branch. I need to specify the branch name...
